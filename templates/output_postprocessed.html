    <h4>Lesson Q</h4>
    <div class='lesson'>
        <p>
            Sent. Tell me when you start on first slide. So i can give you exercises for it ‎. image omitted. And you also need to print one of these to help you understand how the shake change slightly with place in Word. But not that difficult you will figure it out. The slides i sent so help you memorize quickly i hope. For first slide (which is actually slide 17!) try to listen to arabic vowel sounds on YouTube. Alif waw yaa. I think also on you tube they have animations for how to write them. After you master 1.the shape, 2.the signs ,3.how to write them, then time for excercise. For alif write Navid, but just substitute the A with arabic alif. Alif gives the sound s of A in Navid or obama, and also the sound of A in mAn. But not the normal sound of A like in gAy, smile!. Alif is straight not gay. When it comes in the beginning of Word it gets a glottal stop mark above it. Which is the controversial hamza. For now just know that because of pronouncing a stop with the throat when alif comes in start of Word, we mark it with this hamza, like the weird Apple. But it can come below the alif line the word Islam. Notice the difference in sound of the throat or glottal stop. Now you can write, mAn and substitute the A with alif. Now for the wow sound, it's shape is a whirl. Its name is waaw, the A is like the one in obAma. It looks like a 9. When it comes at the beginning of a word it is pronounced WU like in woman. Or wo like in wall. So remember Alif with mAn and waaw with WUman! Notice the curves, smile. Now you can write woman in English but substitute the wo with waaw. When it comes in the middle or end of a word it loses the W, and becomes just an U or O. So now write jUdO. In English and just substitute the letters with waaw. Also the word week. And now write this first word all in Arabic, WoW. If you could write it then you had learned successfully the first and most important two letters/vowels of Arabic. The final vowel is Yaa'. Which is the last letter of arabic. It looks like a Y inverted 90 degrees. And it actually is a Y when it comes in the start of a word. The two dots below it, you can remember from the two dots in the yin Yang symbol. When it comes in the beginning it is a Yaa or Yuu or Yo depending on the diacritic symbols written above or below it (usually not written, these are the short vowel sounds, they are guessed from context). Which is actually the most confusing thing for a beginner. The vowels when they are short are not written. They are written only when they are clear sounding or emphasized or long. Back to yaa' it is pronounced Y in the beginning of a word. And E in the middle or end. Now you can write Year. gIve. grEEn. gAYd. =guide. Also it has one more special sound, which is the gAy sound of A in mate, hate, nation, rate, blade. All those As are written with yaa. Focus on this because it confuses many even arabic speakers. To wind up t the vowels write. Way. Yo yo. Yaw. Wowy. And the name of the letter Y in English, write its sound using the vowels. End of lesson 1. Good luck.  Yaa is basically an E. Just turns to Ya, yi, yu, when it comes in the beginning. The important thing is to connect and link the sound with shape. Please do page 5. The B sound. And try to see on YouTube how it's written in start middle end stand alone positions. Then write these words. Baba (same like papa, because there is actually no p sound!). Booboo. Baby. Then write first two letters of police and complete with lice in English. Then lesson 3 is the letter TA, which i call the magnified T. It's a t but heavier in sound. Then write,. TAco. BuTt. TAbeeb (Doctor in Arabic). Toob (adobe or bricks). Lesson 4, page 7,is the regular t, quite easy and straightforward. Write :. Two. Too. Boot. Tab. Tight (that's tricky!).

            Very good. Just the tab is a soft t. تاب. تابلتtablet. Bravo you will never forget those inshallah. Lesson 5,page 8 G. This letter has a dual nature, same like the English G. The English G is pronounced differently in these two words :. Green. paGe. The Arabic standard pronunciation is J like in Japan. However in some dialects like Egyptian it is pronounced G line in Green. So let's say both are correct and understandable, so choose whichever pronunciation from both. Note: ( there are 5 letters that can be connected only to the preceding letters, namely: A, wow, and the others coming soon). Basically connecting letters is easy you just use a dash to connect, going from right to left. But notice that usually the standalone (or a more accurate name, the full shape) shape of some letters changes a bit when it comes at the end of a word. Just by adding an open ring usually to the right of to the left. Like this G/j. ج. Or just جبل. When it is connected to the letter after it, it continues moving instead of closing with the curved ring. Try to use a pencil to write, don't type only. Gaat. Gut. Jeep. Job. Big. Bag. Togo. Egypt. (the i in the beginning of a word line islam is written with an alif, but below this alif is a hamza(glotal stop) to denote the E sound. I hope you understand what a glottal stop sounds like. I am glad also you have written baby correctly. Because many people make a mistake and write the a in baby as alif. But it is e like in pEn. Now write Egypt. Lesson 6،page 9 S:. That letter looks like a snake indeed both in Arabic and in English!. Note how the standalone or final shape closes with a ring (a bit different ring than the G though but and idea). Listen to the sound in YouTube and see how it's written. Now write,. Stop. Swiss. Site (write the vowels here for practice even if they are short). Site. Pizza= peetsa. Space. Goose. City. Lesson 6,page 10 SA. This letter is peculiar to arabic. And i can it the heavy S. Listen to it on YouTube and you will see it is a magnified S. Now write. Saga. Sub. Substitute. Send me the exercise answers when you finish. May God teach you! Smile. Nb, if you have whatsapp for desktop, please collect those lessons in a word file or so, maybe we can share it later with other members ‎. image omitted. Bought a guitar Alhamdulellah.

            Lesson 11 ,page 15. The next two letters should be studied together. They are like two opposite twin brothers. The one in page 15 is HA. it's pronounced like a heavy h. Or to be more accurate like the sound you make when you blow air from your throat into your hands during winter when it's cold. To make it warm. That's why this letter is related to warmth, heat and feelings as we shall see. Arabic uses the whole range of sounds we can produce, from the top of the tongue back till the middle of the throat. This letter comes from the deepest place!. I guess that's an it's related to emotions. There are many words that start with this letter, that conveys the meanings of heat and feelings. حب love. حرب war. (heat of the battle!). حفلة party. (hot party!). Hhobb=love, Hharb=war. Hhafla=party. Also Hharara= heat. Hhatab=firewood. Hhayy=Alive. Hhorreyya= freedom. Hhess=emotion. Hhanaan=kindness. FaraHh=wedding. Or=happiness. JarHh=wound (can be emotional wound). So as you can see that letter is unique Subhanallah. If you pronounce it right you will feel that it's coming from deep inside your throat, actually from a deeper place in your lungs near your heart!. So it is a very expressive letter. In the other hand his twin brother is a loser, that's why we differentiate him by an added dot. The sound here is more superficial. Coming from the top of the throat. Like the hocking sound when people spit!. And look the ugly insensitive words related to this letter Kha in contrast with its twin Hha. Kha'ef= afraid. Kha'en=traitor. Kharaab=destruction. Khatima=ending. Khaser=loser. Khabeeth=cunning. Khadsh=scratch (superficial!). Khed'a=trick. Khorda=scrap. Kharif=autumn. Khodoo'a=yielding. Khateer=dangerous. Of course not all the words that have that letter are negative, but this is the general feel of the letter even the sound is a bit ugly!. -study these two contrasting twin letters together and you will never forget them. Now the exercise :. 1-Hh. Hhabeeby=my lover. This is a recurring word in most arabic songs!. 2-Kh. Write KhuTt=handwriting or line. Kharab= destruction. And don't forget to write Hhob=love. And Hhasaas=sensitive. Pay attention to the long and short vowels that are not written. You can check pronunciation on forvo. Com. Lesson 12 ,page 18:. This letter is super easy and straightforward. Same like the English D. This is the third letter after alif and waw that connects only to the letter before it. And doesn't connect after. Write :. Drop. Dash. Shade. Bad. Bed. Door. Dice. Dog. Dot. Ideas (tricky). Chad (Country name). Good luck. Salam alaykum. It is proving difficult to follow my persian language teacher. Now i understand why my method is important. They just throw you in a pool of vocab and grammar then tell you can catch the language from just exposure!. I don't think this classic method works, at least not for me!. I don't know why i stopped working on my method. It is complete for arabic and was working on french, Spanish, Japanese and persian.

            👍🏻 good. So you are getting familiar with the letters. They ain't that difficult right. Lesson 13 ,page 19:. The next letter is called THaal. It looks like a d but with a dot above it. You put the tip of your tongue between your front teeth. Pronounced similar to the English THE. If you remember on page 11 we took another letter Thaa, ث which also needs the top of the tongue to stick in between the front teeth. Now write :. Bathtub. The good, the bad. The egg. Lesson 14 ,page 20:. This letter could be confused with the previous letter so pay extra attention to the sound. If you pronounce mother in the American way. The THA sound in mothaa is a heavy sound of thaal (the previous letter page 19). Just a different tone, a magnified sound of the English The. Try to write Abu THAbi. Which is a city written Abu Dhabi. Put the sound that have 'heavy' counterparts in a separate excel table for your personal study. Lesson 15 ,page 21:. The next letter is a heavy D!. It's a unique letter that's why they call arabic the language of Daad. It is like the sound of the D in DUck but with stress on DU. This it is a magnified D. Exercise :. Bud. Dub. Mud. Almost there, only 3 sessions left!

            Lesson 19 ,page 25:. This letter is an English L sound. Easy to remember as it resembles a leg. Note that the full shape when it comes at the end of the word or standalone had a ring at the bottom. Exercise :. Leg. Legacy. Flevor (there is no V in Arabic, usually written as F). But there are no arabic words with V. Actually i forgot to mention that we took already the 5 letters that are connected only to the preceding letter. ا. و. ر. د. ذ. These letters never connect after. Usually when you write you leave the letter open (open dash, not closed) until you reach the next letter. However with those 5 letters you may close them since they don't get connected to the letter coming after them in a word. Example. دار =Home. The D is closed, the alef also stops and is not connected to the R after it. If we write "gap" in Arabic letters. جاب. The alif gets connected only to the preceding G. Usually you will keep extending the G with an open dash (without closing it with the ring) until you meet the next letter which is an alif in this case. Then since the alif is ONE of the 5 letters (you can remember them with the word ZADOR) therefore it stops there, then you start with the next letter. Lesson 20 ,page 26:. This is one of the easy letters to remember the M. Same sound like the English M. Exercise :. Mama. Mira. Alarm. AHmad. Mohamad = MHMD (because the story vowels are omitted). Marcos. Barak Obama. Mac. Lesson 21 ,page 27:. Straightforward N sound. Exercise :. Navid. Marius. Mervet. Hakim. Sade. Majorie. Lagoon. Man. Woman. Neglect. North. Throne. Anarchy. End.

That knotted T comes only at the end of a Word denoting the female gender of the word (yes words in Arabic have gender!). The confusing shape at the end, resembles an H but with an added two dots (like the letter T). However they both are pronounced H!. Lesson 23 ,page 28:. Same as we did with the twin letters ح and خ. This is another twin. The letter 'A called' Aayn (which means eye in Arabic). And the twin which comes with the same shape but with a dot above it denoting the negative traits of it!. The twin's name is GHayn. The gh has a special pronunciation same like the french pronunciation of the R, a gragling sound that comes from the back ceiling of the mouth. But the good brother 'Ayn needs you to use a muscle in your throat, can be done if you press gently on your Adam's apple while saying apple. It needs some practice, but it's important at least for the simple fact that the very word Araby or Arabic starts with it!. Words starting with the good brother 'Ayn:. Bride work car flag honey perfume mind justice. Words starting with the naughty brother Ghayn:. Strange cheater meager angry stupid heedless mistake. Even the sound of it is not very clean!. However we can still appreciate, i just use this story to fix it in your mind with associations. Exercise for ع 'Ayn:. Write honey on arabic, 'Asal. Write work, 'Amal. Write Arabic, 'Araby. Write exhibition, Ma'AraD. Write he sold, Baa'A. Exercise for غ GHayn:. Write strange, GHaReeB. Write he forgives, YaGHFeR. Write emptiness (of space or time), FaRaaGH. Note that when i write a long vowel like aa, ee, it should be written, but when is short it's omitted like a, e. End.
