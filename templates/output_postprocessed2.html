    <h4>Lesson 1 &mdash; ا و ي</h4>
    <div class='lesson'>
        <p>
            The first lesson consists of the Arabic letters alif, waw, and yaa. After you master (1) the shape, (2) the signs, and (3)
            how to write them, then time for the exercises. Alif gives the sounds of the A in 
            N<b>a</b>vid or Ob<b>a</b>ma, and also the sound of A in m<b>a</b>n. But not the normal sound of A like in g<b>a</b>y,
            smile! Alif is straight not gay. When it comes in the beginning of Word it gets a glottal stop mark above it.
            Which is the controversial hamza. For now just know that because of pronouncing a stop with the throat when alif
            comes in start of Word, we mark it with this hamza, like the weird Apple. But it can come below the alif like
            the word Islam. Notice the difference in sound of the throat or glottal stop.
        </p>

            <p class="mb-0">
                Now you can write m<b>a</b>n and N<b>a</b>vid, substituting the A with alif.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        

        
        <p>

            Now for the wow sound, its shape is a whirl. Its name is waaw, and the A is like the one in ob<b>a</b>ma. It
            looks like a 9. When it comes at the beginning of a word it is pronounced "wu" like in woman. Or "wo" like in
            wall. So remember Alif with m<b>a</b>n and waaw with w<b>u</b>man! Notice the curves, smile. it comes in the
            middle or end of a word it loses the W, and becomes just a U or an O.
        </p>

            <hr>
            <p class="mb-0">
                Write woman in English but substitute the "wo" with waaw. Write j<b>u</b>d<b>o</b> and <b>w</b>eek. Now write
                this first word all in Arabic, <b>w</b>o<b>w</b>. If you could write it then you had learned successfully
                the first and most important two letters/vowels of Arabic.
            </p>

        <p>
            The final vowel is Yaa'. Which is the last letter of Arabic. It looks like a Y inverted 90 degrees. And it actually is a
            Y when it comes in the start of a word. The two dots below it, you can remember from the two dots in the Yin
            and Yang symbol. When it comes in the beginning it is a Yaa or Yuu or Yo depending on the diacritic symbols written
            above or below it (usually not written, these are the short vowel sounds, they are guessed from context). Which
            is actually the most confusing thing for a beginner. The vowels when they are short are not written. They are
            written only when they are clear sounding or emphasized or long. Back to yaa', it is pronounced Y in the beginning
            of a word, and E in the middle or end. Also it has one more
            special sound, which is the g<b>a</b>y sound of A in mate, hate, nation, rate, blade. All those As are written with
            yaa. Focus on this because it confuses even many arabic speakers. End of lesson 1. Good luck.

            Very good. Just the tab is a soft t. تاب. تابلتtablet. Bravo you will never forget those inshallah. Lesson 5,page 8 G. This
            letter has a dual nature, same like the English G. The English G is pronounced differently in these two words
            :. Green. paGe. The Arabic standard pronunciation is J like in Japan. However in some dialects like Egyptian
            it is pronounced G line in Green. So let's say both are correct and understandable, so choose whichever pronunciation
            from both. Note: ( there are 5 letters that can be connected only to the preceding letters, namely: A, wow, and
            the others coming soon). Basically connecting letters is easy you just use a dash to connect, going from right
            to left. But notice that usually the standalone (or a more accurate name, the full shape) shape of some letters
            changes a bit when it comes at the end of a word. Just by adding an open ring usually to the right of to the
            left. Like this G/j. ج. Or just جبل. When it is connected to the letter after it, it continues moving instead
            of closing with the curved ring. Try to use a pencil to write, don't type only. Gaat. Gut. Jeep. Job. Big. Bag.
            Togo. Egypt. (the i in the beginning of a word line islam is written with an alif, but below this alif is a hamza(glotal
            stop) to denote the E sound. I hope you understand what a glottal stop sounds like. I am glad also you have written
            baby correctly. Because many people make a mistake and write the a in baby as alif. But it is e like in pEn.
            Now write Egypt. Lesson 6،page 9 S:. That letter looks like a snake indeed both in Arabic and in English!. Note
            how the standalone or final shape closes with a ring (a bit different ring than the G though but and idea). Listen
            to the sound in YouTube and see how it's written. Now write,. Stop. Swiss. Site (write the vowels here for practice
            even if they are short). Site. Pizza= peetsa. Space. Goose. City. Lesson 6,page 10 SA. This letter is peculiar
            to arabic. And i can it the heavy S. Listen to it on YouTube and you will see it is a magnified S. Now write.

            Lesson 11 ,page 15. The next two letters should be studied together. They are like two opposite twin brothers. The one in
            page 15 is HA. it's pronounced like a heavy h. Or to be more accurate like the sound you make when you blow air
            from your throat into your hands during winter when it's cold. To make it warm. That's why this letter is related
            to warmth, heat and feelings as we shall see. Arabic uses the whole range of sounds we can produce, from the
            top of the tongue back till the middle of the throat. This letter comes from the deepest place!. I guess that's
            an it's related to emotions. There are many words that start with this letter, that conveys the meanings of heat
            and feelings. حب love. حرب war. (heat of the battle!). حفلة party. (hot party!). Hhobb=love, Hharb=war. Hhafla=party.
            Also Hharara= heat. Hhatab=firewood. Hhayy=Alive. Hhorreyya= freedom. Hhess=emotion. Hhanaan=kindness. FaraHh=wedding.
            Or=happiness. JarHh=wound (can be emotional wound). So as you can see that letter is unique Subhanallah. If you
            pronounce it right you will feel that it's coming from deep inside your throat, actually from a deeper place
            in your lungs near your heart!. So it is a very expressive letter. In the other hand his twin brother is a loser,
            that's why we differentiate him by an added dot. The sound here is more superficial. Coming from the top of the
            throat. Like the hocking sound when people spit!. And look the ugly insensitive words related to this letter
            Kha in contrast with its twin Hha. Kha'ef= afraid. Kha'en=traitor. Kharaab=destruction. Khatima=ending. Khaser=loser.
            Khabeeth=cunning. Khadsh=scratch (superficial!). Khed'a=trick. Khorda=scrap. Kharif=autumn. Khodoo'a=yielding.
            Khateer=dangerous. Of course not all the words that have that letter are negative, but this is the general feel
            of the letter even the sound is a bit ugly!. -study these two contrasting twin letters together and you will
            never forget them. Now the exercise :. 1-Hh. Hhabeeby=my lover. This is a recurring word in most arabic songs!.
            2-Kh. Write KhuTt=handwriting or line. Kharab= destruction. And don't forget to write Hhob=love. And Hhasaas=sensitive.
            Pay attention to the long and short vowels that are not written. You can check pronunciation on forvo. Com. Lesson
            12 ,page 18:. This letter is super easy and straightforward. Same like the English D. This is the third letter
            after alif and waw that connects only to the letter before it. And doesn't connect after. Write :. Drop. Dash.
            Shade. Bad. Bed. Door. Dice. Dog. Dot. Ideas (tricky). Chad (Country name). Good luck. Salam alaykum. It is proving
            difficult to follow my persian language teacher. Now i understand why my method is important. They just throw
            you in a pool of vocab and grammar then tell you can catch the language from just exposure!. I don't think this
            classic method works, at least not for me!. I don't know why i stopped working on my method. It is complete for
            arabic and was working on french, Spanish, Japanese and persian.

            👍🏻 good. So you are getting familiar with the letters. They ain't that difficult right. Lesson 13 ,page 19:. The next letter
            is called THaal. It looks like a d but with a dot above it. You put the tip of your tongue between your front
            teeth. Pronounced similar to the English THE. If you remember on page 11 we took another letter Thaa, ث which
            also needs the top of the tongue to stick in between the front teeth. Now write :. Bathtub. The good, the bad.
            The egg. Lesson 14 ,page 20:. This letter could be confused with the previous letter so pay extra attention to
            the sound. If you pronounce mother in the American way. The THA sound in mothaa is a heavy sound of thaal (the
            previous letter page 19). Just a different tone, a magnified sound of the English The. Try to write Abu THAbi.
            Which is a city written Abu Dhabi. Put the sound that have 'heavy' counterparts in a separate excel table for
            your personal study. Lesson 15 ,page 21:. The next letter is a heavy D!. It's a unique letter that's why they
            call arabic the language of Daad. It is like the sound of the D in DUck but with stress on DU. This it is a magnified
            D. Exercise :. Bud. Dub. Mud. Almost there, only 3 sessions left!

            Lesson 19 ,page 25:. This letter is an English L sound. Easy to remember as it resembles a leg. Note that the full shape
            when it comes at the end of the word or standalone had a ring at the bottom. Exercise :. Leg. Legacy. Flevor
            (there is no V in Arabic, usually written as F). But there are no arabic words with V. Actually i forgot to mention
            that we took already the 5 letters that are connected only to the preceding letter. ا. و. ر. د. ذ. These letters
            never connect after. Usually when you write you leave the letter open (open dash, not closed) until you reach
            the next letter. However with those 5 letters you may close them since they don't get connected to the letter
            coming after them in a word. Example. دار =Home. The D is closed, the alef also stops and is not connected to
            the R after it. If we write "gap" in Arabic letters. جاب. The alif gets connected only to the preceding G. Usually
            you will keep extending the G with an open dash (without closing it with the ring) until you meet the next letter
            which is an alif in this case. Then since the alif is ONE of the 5 letters (you can remember them with the word
            ZADOR) therefore it stops there, then you start with the next letter. Lesson 20 ,page 26:. This is one of the
            easy letters to remember the M. Same sound like the English M. Exercise :. Mama. Mira. Alarm. AHmad. Mohamad
            = MHMD (because the story vowels are omitted). Marcos. Barak Obama. Mac. Lesson 21 ,page 27:. Straightforward
            N sound. Exercise :. Navid. Marius. Mervet. Hakim. Sade. Majorie. Lagoon. Man. Woman. Neglect. North. Throne.
            Anarchy. End.

            Lesson 22, page 28: straightforward h, same as English h. Notice the difference in shape among the start, middle, and standalone variants. 
            Exercises: hand, hunter, human, alcohol, foghorn.
            Notice that when it comes at the end of the word (connected to preceding
            letter) it might be confused with the shape of a special character called the knotted T, ة. That knotted T comes
            only at the end of a word denoting the female gender of the word (yes words in Arabic have gender!). The confusing
            shape at the end, resembles an H but with an added two dots (like the letter T). However they both are pronounced
            H!. Lesson 23 ,page 28:. Same as we did with the twin letters ح and خ. This is another twin. The letter 'A called'
            Aayn (which means eye in Arabic). And the twin which comes with the same shape but with a dot above it denoting
            the negative traits of it!. The twin's name is GHayn. The gh has a special pronunciation same like the french
            pronunciation of the R, a gragling sound that comes from the back ceiling of the mouth. But the good brother
            'Ayn needs you to use a muscle in your throat, can be done if you press gently on your Adam's apple while saying
            apple. It needs some practice, but it's important at least for the simple fact that the very word Araby or Arabic
            starts with it!. Words starting with the good brother 'Ayn:. Bride work car flag honey perfume mind justice.
            Words starting with the naughty brother Ghayn:. Strange cheater meager angry stupid heedless mistake. Even the
            sound of it is not very clean!. However we can still appreciate, i just use this story to fix it in your mind
            with associations. Exercise for ع 'Ayn:. Write honey on arabic, 'Asal. Write work, 'Amal. Write Arabic, 'Araby.
            Write exhibition, Ma'AraD. Write he sold, Baa'A. Exercise for غ GHayn:. Write strange, GHaReeB. Write he forgives,
            YaGHFeR. Write emptiness (of space or time), FaRaaGH. Note that when i write a long vowel like aa, ee, it should
            be written, but when is short it's omitted like a, e. End.
